unsetenv SHIFT_GUI_DEBUG
unsetenv SHIFT_DEBUG
unsetenv SHIFT_DUMP_CONTINUOUS
unsetenv SHIFT_INSTALLROOT
unsetenv SHIFT_TKDIR
unsetenv SHIFT_GUI_SERVER

# SHIFT_NSTEPS -- This environment variable specifies how many
# simulation steps you will run

setenv SHIFT_NSTEPS 1000000

# SHIFT_ISTEP -- This environment variable specifies the valu of the
# time increment in the simulation. The default is 0.05.

setenv SHIFT_ISTEP 0.05


# SHIFT_GUI_DEBUG SHIFT_DEBUG SHIFT_DUMP_CONTINUOUS
# Only one of these next three variables needs to be set. The first
# will load the graphical debugger, SHIFT_DEBUG will load the line
# debugger, and SHIFT_DUMP_CONTINUOUS will dump all the simulation
# data into the specified file.

# setenv SHIFT_GUI_DEBUG

setenv SHIFT_DEBUG


# SHIFT_DUMP_CONTINUOUS --

# setenv SHIFT_DUMP_CONTINUOUS

# 
# If you have set the SHIFT_GUI_DEBUG variable, you may choose to have
# the debugger use the tcl/tk files from /usr/path/src/shift/ or from
# the directory you run the GUI from.  By default, it souces the
# /usr/path files.  The SHIFT_GUI_SERVER variable determines what
# server the GUI will assume is running the simulation and what
# sockets will be used to communicate.

setenv SHIFT_GUI_SERVER "`hostname` 528 529"


# These may be set if you have set SHIFT_DEBUG set also.

# setenv SHIFT_OUTPUT_FILE
# setenv SHIFT_DEBUG_SCRIPT


# SHIFT_INSTALLROOT
# Change this variable(s) to your liking (note that they are generated
# by 'configure'.)

# SHIFT_TKDIR
# Change this variable to your liking.  (Note: the quotes are
