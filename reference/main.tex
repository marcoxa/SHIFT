\section*{Acknowledgements}

Most of the ideas in this manual are the result of discussions
involving the authors and other PATH members. In particular we have
greatly benefited from discussions with Datta Godbole, Raja Sengupta
and Pravin Varaiya.

%The model was proposed
%by Akash Deshpande and supported by Pravin Varaiya.  The inheritance
%mechanism was proposed by Alex G\"oll\"u.  The separation of state,
%input, and output was proposed by Raja Sengupta and Datta Godbole.
%Luigi Semenzato put everything together.
