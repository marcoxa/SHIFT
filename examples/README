Alphabetical listing and a brief description of example programs.

bounce.hs	Bouncing balls (or pool table) example. Shows how
		discrete states and flow equations can be used to
		describe the behavior of components
cfunction.hs    Gives an example of linking in c functions
		This program must be linked with cfun.o.
linklist.hs	Gives an example of how to construct link lists
ljoin.hs	Three vehicles that communicate and form a platoon.
		Example contains fairly complex synchronization
		sequences and reset actions. It is documented in the
		file ljoin.doc.
manySprings.hs  Oscillating Springs
		Example of synchronizing with all elements of a set
manySprings2.hs Similar to manySprings.hs.
		Example of synchronizing with one element of a set
manySprings3.hs A specification that results in no transitions.
		Illustrates how NOT to use set synchronization
mutex.hs	Another example of synchronizing with one element of a set.
		Implement mutual exclusion.
particle.hs	Midsize example that illustrates several features.
		Example is discussed in the paper.
precedence.hs	Example that discusses precedence rules for 
		initializing variables at instantiation.
setupprec.hs    Example that illustrates precedence rules in setup
		actions.
tank_monit.hs	Examples of i/o connection and synchronization of
		independent components
rccircuit.hs	Simple rc-circuit. Examples of differential and
		algebraic variables and component creation.
