<H2> Shiftdoc: enforcing public interfaces in Shift types </H2>

<H3> What </H3>
<B>Shiftdoc</B> is a tool to extract HTML reference documentation from
a Shift source file. The idea behind it is that of being able to maintain 
a single source, both for a program and for its documentation. 

<P>

The documentation informations must be contained inside special comments,
called <I>doc-comments</I>. When the user wants to add to the HTML reference
file some documentation for a Shift syntactic entity (e.g. a transition), he
or she just needs to write a <I>doc-comment</I> before that entity in
the Shift source.

<H3> Why </H3>
An object-oriented software system can be studied through its interfaces. 
Tipically, interfaces can be private or public (actually other kinds of 
interfaces exist, but they won't be covered here).

<P>

Private interfaces are used by the programmers of the system to obtain an 
implementation. Public ones are used by the end-users of the system. If 
data-hiding is available, the end-users cannot access the private interface.

<P>

The documentation of a software system is also divided in two parts. The
private interface is tipically described with comments inside the source.
The public one is described both with comments and with reference manuals.
It turns out that most of the informations inside the public-interface 
comments are the same as those inside the reference manuals. 

<P>

This brings up the two reasons why <B>Shiftdoc</B> was written:
<UL>

<LI> 
the ability to keep reference documentation and public-interface 
comments in one place (the <I>doc-comments</I>). This avoids duplication 
of information.
</LI>

<P>

<LI>
most importantly, the ability to distinguish between public and private
interfaces (which is a feature that Shift doesn't support directly).
All entities belonging to the public interface should be described by 
<I>doc-comments</I>. Other entities can be described with normal comments.
In this way the HTML reference - which is public by nature - can be
obtained automatically from the source file.
</LI>

</UL>

<H3> How </H3>

A <I>doc-comment</I> is sintactically similar to a normal comment. It has
the following format: <BR>
<PRE> /** <I>doc-body</I> */ </PRE> <BR>
The <I>doc-body</I> can contain text and newline characters. Be careful: 
unlike normal comments a space or tab is required between the <I>doc-body</I>
and the */.

<P>

The <I>doc-body</I> can also contain special commands:

<UL>

<LI>
<PRE> $AUTHOR <I>name</I>$ </PRE> Inserts the name of the author.
This command is tipically used in <I>doc-comments</I> for types.
</LI>

<P>

<LI>
<PRE> $VERSION <I>version number</I>$ </PRE> inserts the version number.
This command is tipically used in <I>doc-comments</I> for types.
</LI>

<P>

<LI>
<PRE> $SINCE <I>date</I>$ </PRE> Inserts the date since when the 
commented feature was available.
</LI>

<P>

<LI>
<PRE> $SEE <I>type-name</I>$ </PRE> Inserts an hyper-link to the HTML
reference of  type <I>type-name</I>.
</LI>

</UL>

Inside a <I>doc-body</I>, any sequence of leading asterisks, preceded by 
zero or more space or tabs and followed by at least one space or tab, 
is discarded. This feature can be used for esthetic purposes: <BR>

<PRE>
discrete
	/**
	 *  Documentation for state dummy.
	 */
	dummy
</PRE>

HTML tags can be embedded within the <I>doc-body</I>, however the use
of H<I>x</I> tags is discouraged, because it interferes with the standard
formatting of the HTML document.

<P>

<I>Doc-comments</I> must be used before the syntactic entity they
describe. 

<P>

<STRONG> NOTE: </STRONG> <B>Shiftdoc</B> version 0.8 and earlier had a bug,
that raised an exception to the previous rule: <I>doc-comments</I> for types
had to be written before the type body. In version 0.9 the bug has been
fixed: now <I>doc-comments</I> for types are placed before the type 
declaration, just like you do for other syntactic entities.

<P>

<B>Shiftdoc</B> generates one HTML file per type in the current
directory. It is called in the following way:
<PRE>shiftdoc <I>sourcefile</I>.hs </PRE>
To view the version number:
<PRE>shiftdoc -v </PRE>


<HR>

<P>

Here follows a sample doc-commented Shift source file.
<PRE>
 
global Foo m := create(Foo);

global set(Bar) S;

 
/**
 * $AUTHOR Marco Zandonadi$ 
 * $VERSION 93.39$
 * You can read $SEE Bar$ as well.
 * 
 */ 
type Foo 
{
	output 
		continuous number x;
}

/** 
 * $SEE Foo$ is the parent of this type.
 */ 
type Bar : Foo
{
	setup
		do {
			/** Did you know that k=x? */
			/* A normal comment here   */
			k:=x;	
		};


	output 
		/** 
	 	 **** Some leading asterisks
	 	 */ 
		continuous number x := -1, k, h;


	flow	
		/** Description of default flow    */
		default {
			/** A flow equation */
			x = if h=0 then 7 else 8;
		};


	discrete
		/** State s is very important      */
		s;


	export
		/** This event is called e         */
		e;


	transition
		/** A transition from s to s.
		 *  $SINCE 12-13-1970$
		 */
		s -> s {
			/** It synchronizes with e */
			e
		} 

		when x > .7 

		do { 	
			/** A do action */
			x := -x; 
		};
}
