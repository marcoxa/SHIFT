Wed Apr 15 16:33:21 1998  Tunc Simsek  <simsek@maruti.PATH.berkeley.edu>

	* include/shifttypes.h: Adding support for external data types.

Tue Oct 28 11:18:29 1997  Daniel Wiesmann  <danielw@alfa.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* socket: Removed the config.c, config.h, and the init.h
	files. Made the other functions portable for WIN32. 

Mon Oct 27 16:09:45 1997  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@infiniti.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* socket: added framework to write a minimal portable layer over
	the socket interface in order to take in to account MS Windows.

	* socket/socket.c: changed a few things in the file in order to
	make it compile on the SGI.  Cleaned up in the process.

Tue Aug 26 11:26:39 1997  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@infiniti.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* configure.in: Added condition preprocessor variable
	fo OS_MSWINDOWS.

	* include/shift_config.h.in: Added condition preprocessor variable
	fo OS_MSWINDOWS.

Wed Aug 13 14:16:36 1997  Daniel Wiesmann  <danielw@alfa.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* libTcl/animation-update.c (C_UpdateItem): Changed the change of
	the sign or the orientation. Added a <return> bind to the setenv 
	window.

Fri Aug  1 09:57:37 1997  Daniel Wiesmann  <danielw@alfa.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* Made some changes to the animation-update.c file which was not
	returning TCL_OK. 
	
	* libTcl/graph-plots.tcl: Changed the labels of graphs from
	TimeClick to Time.

Mon Jul 28 14:33:32 1997  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@infiniti.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* libDebug/shift_api_info.c (shift_api_make_array_value): fixed
	printing of arrays of instances.

Wed Jul 16 12:28:13 1997  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@infiniti.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* libDebug/shift_api_info.c (shift_api_make_user_value): Added
	zeroing of the heap allocated instance if no component is actually
	passed in.  Some versions of malloc do not zero the memory and
	this resulted in a bad reference down the line when printing an
	instance.

Thu Jul  3 11:18:54 1997  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@infiniti.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* Modified several calls to 'malloc' into 'safe_malloc'.  This
	also required making the external definition of this function
	available in the file 'include/run-time.h'.

Thu Jun 12 09:59:41 1997  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@infiniti.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* run-time/collection.c (set_membership_X): added specialized
 	functions for testing membership in number, symbol, array, set,
 	and instance sets.
	(set_equal): added proper definition for 'set_equal'.

	* Fixed bug with set membership testing of constant elements.
	Modifications in 'include/collection.h', 'run-time/collection.c',
	and 'compiler/generate.c'.  Possible problems without new hash
	code may lurk somewhere.

Thu May 15 15:13:53 1997  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@infiniti.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* Changed all the .in files and the configuration scripts in order
	to remove all the dependencies from Itcl/ and Itk.

Wed May 14 08:31:07 1997  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@infiniti.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* Added preliminary Foreign Function interface.  A 'function' can
	now have arrays as arguments and parameters declared as 'in' or
	'out' (a la' Ada - with no combinations).  Most machinery is
	"incremental": old programs work without modification.

	Note however that the FFI may break the RHS first LHS next rule,
	when 'out' parameters are present in a function call.

	* Fixed bugs here and there.

Mon Mar  3 11:12:32 1997  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@infiniti.PATH.Berkeley.EDU>

	* Added construction of binary distribution.

	* Changed the packaging scheme for SHIFT.  Now the tar file
	unpacks in a directory called 'shift'.  The configuration process
	must take place in there.
